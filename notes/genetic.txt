- Seems like memory size 2-3 creates optimal performance
- Increasing memory size past this has negative effects

- Fitness function may be biased towards bots which tend to cooperate
- Putting all winning bots and all classic bots in a tournament against one
    another produces the all defect bot as a winner
- The fitness function may need to be adapted to include more bots
    which tend to defect in order to increase average score

- Adding more defect bots to the evaluation function didn't help
- Maybe the genetic bots playing against each other hurts their scores?

- Seems like memory size 2-3 creates optimal performance
- Increasing memory size past this has negative effects

- Fitness function may be biased towards bots which tend to cooperate
- Putting all winning bots and all classic bots in a tournament against one
    another produces the all defect bot as a winner
- The fitness function may need to be adapted to include more bots
    which tend to defect in order to increase average score

- Adding more defect bots to the evaluation function didn't help
- Maybe the genetic bots playing against each other hurts their scores?

- Attempted finding distance from tit for tat
- Didn't work out very well

- Fitness function performance vs tit for tat bot did very well
- Seems to be able to defend against defect bots well

- Fitness function vs tft and vs all bots gives very similar
    performance (on average almost exactly the same)
- tft runs much faster and gives opportunity to run more tests



- Effects of changing population size v.s. generation size
* over 100 trials
============================================================

generations = 10,   population = 10 => average 2289.67
generations = 100,  population = 10 => average 2254.17
generations = 1000, population = 10 => average 2274.19

------------------------------------------------------

generations = 10, population = 10   => average 2244.92
generations = 10, population = 100  => average 2538.21
generations = 10, population = 1000 => average 2629.73

Increasing population size is more effective than increasing generations

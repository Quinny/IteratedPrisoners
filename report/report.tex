\section{Abstract}

This paper explores the use of multiple Artificial Intelligence algorithms to
create optimal strategies to compete in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.  The
study begins by examining the use of a genetic algorithm to breed the perfect
prisoner.  Several different configurations and fitness functions were tested and
the performance of each was contrasted.  The genetic algorithm was able to
consistently breed well performing prisoners.
A hill climbing approach was then taken,
which proved to be ineffective at producing a competitive strategy given the
lack of a natural successor function. Finally, machine learning... <INSERT

section of this paper.

\section{Introduction}
The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic example of game theory which demonstrates
that two agents acting for their own self interest may not result in an
optimal outcome for either agent.  The prisoner's
dilemma is as follows: \\ \\
Two individuals (herein Bob and Alice) have been arrested and placed in solitary
confinement so that they may not communicate with one another.  Each of them hope
to spend the least amount of time in prison.  The prosecutor approaches them
and offers the following deal:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If Bob and Alice betray (herein defect) each other, they will
        both serve 2 years in prison
    \item If Bob defects but Alice remains silent (herein cooperate), Bob
        will be set free and Alice will spend 3 years in prison (and vice versa)
    \item If Bob and Alice both cooperate they will each spend 1 year in prison
        on a lesser charge \\
\end{itemize}

The iterated version of the prisoner's dilemma is simply a sequence of rounds of
the above mentioned game.  A player's score is the summation of their score in
each round. \\

It is implied that Bob and Alice will have no interactions with each other after
their decisions and thus cannot punish/reward their accomplice. If Bob and Alice are
both rational and self centered then they will both choose to defect, as defecting
yields the highest probability of a favourable outcome.  It is interesting to note
that if the prisoners act non-rationally and choose to cooperate
(the "riskier" option) they will spend 1/3 of the time in prison compared
to the rational option. \\

{Evolving Strategies for the Prisoner's Dilemma}}
the payoff matrix for this study has been
inverted such that a higher score implies a lesser sentence. \\
